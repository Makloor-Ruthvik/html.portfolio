<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings! My name is Ruthvik, and I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Gurunanak College in Hyderabad. I am an enthusiastic and curious individual with a passion for technology and its ever-evolving possibilities.</p>
<p>During my leisure time, you'll often find me engrossed in reading comics, exploring new information on the internet, or engaging in a thrilling game of chess. These hobbies not only serve as sources of entertainment but also allow me to enhance my creativity and strategic thinking skills.</p>
<p>One of my proudest achievements so far has been qualifying in the Solution Challenge organized by GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs). It was a challenging and fulfilling experience, which not only tested my technical prowess but also helped me grow as a problem solver and collaborator.
